# Cotton-Plant-or-leaf-Disease-Classification

## Aim:
####  Our problem statement is Classifying the given Cotton Plant Or Cotton Leaf is Diseased Or Fresh.As a machine learning enthusiast, I want to apply my machine           learning knowledge to increase the productivity of cotton crops in India.If my model useful for one farmer also that means a lot to me, this idea drives me to do       this project.

### Libraries/ tools used:
1. Numpy
2. Pandas
3. Matplotlib
4. Tenosrflow.Keras
5. Jupyter Notebook

### Description:
1. A set of Images of cotton leaf and plant have been taken and are been divided into 4 classes.
2. This Classification Problem is solved by Deep Learning technique CNN  architecture of different optimizers, loss and dropout layers.
3. Later same images were trained with Transfer Learning technique(InceptionV3) which it can train deep neural networks with fewer data .
